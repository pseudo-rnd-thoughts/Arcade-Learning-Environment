This environment is part of the <a href='..'>Atari environments</a>. Please read that page first for general information.

| Make              | gymnasium.make("ALE/Superman-v5") |
| Action Space      | Discrete(18)                      |
| Observation Space | Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), uint8) |

For more Superman variants with different observation and action spaces, see the variants section.

## Description

Play as Superman trying to capture Lex Luther and avoid the kryptonite satellites along the way.

For a more detailed documentation, see [the AtariAge page](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=533)

## Actions

Superman has the action space `Discrete(18)` with the table below listing the meaning of each action's meanings.
As Superman uses the full set of actions then specifying `full_action_space=True` will not modify the action space of the environment if passed to `gymnasium.make`.

|   Value | Meaning       |
|---------|---------------|
|       0 | NOOP          |
|       1 | FIRE          |
|       2 | UP            |
|       3 | RIGHT         |
|       4 | LEFT          |
|       5 | DOWN          |
|       6 | UPRIGHT       |
|       7 | UPLEFT        |
|       8 | DOWNRIGHT     |
|       9 | DOWNLEFT      |
|      10 | UPFIRE        |
|      11 | RIGHTFIRE     |
|      12 | LEFTFIRE      |
|      13 | DOWNFIRE      |
|      14 | UPRIGHTFIRE   |
|      15 | UPLEFTFIRE    |
|      16 | DOWNRIGHTFIRE |
|      17 | DOWNLEFTFIRE  |

See [environment specification](../env-spec) to see more information on the action meaning.

## Observations

Atari environments have three possible observation types:

- `obs_type="rgb"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="ram"` -> `observation_space=Box(0, 255, (128,), np.uint8)`
- `obs_type="grayscale"` -> `Box(0, 255, (210, 160), np.uint8)`, a grayscale version of the q"rgb" type

See variants section for the type of observation used by each environment id by default.

## Variants

Superman has the following variants of the environment id which have the following differences in observation,
the number of frame-skips and the repeat action probability.

| Env-id          | obs_type=   | frameskip=   | repeat_action_probability=   |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| ALE/Superman-v5 | `rgb`       | `4`          | `0.25`                       |

See the [version history page](https://ale.farama.org/environments/#version-history-and-naming-schemes) to implement previously implemented environments, e.g., `SupermanNoFrameskip-v4`.

## Difficulty and modes

It is possible to specify various flavors of the environment via the keyword arguments `difficulty` and `mode`.
A flavor is a combination of a game mode and a difficulty setting. The table below lists the possible difficulty and mode values
along with the default values.

| Available Modes   | Default Mode   | Available Difficulties   | Default Difficulty   |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `[0]`             | `0`            | `[0, 1, 2, 3]`           | `0`                  |

## Version History

A thorough discussion of the intricate differences between the versions and configurations can be found in the general article on Atari environments.

* v5: Stickiness was added back and stochastic frame-skipping was removed. The environments are now in the "ALE" namespace.
* v4: Stickiness of actions was removed
* v0: Initial versions release
